Rogue Survivor takes inspiration from Vampire Survivors, a roguelike survival game.

In Rogue Survivor, you defeat enemies and attempt to survive the timer. Game over if you lose all your health points. 

The player is controlled using WASD/arrow-keys and will navigate around a '2d' plane. Collision with enemies will reduce the player health point. The player weapon is automatic (no keybind) and will "attack" on a set interval, sending projectiles in a unique pattern. Enemies hit by these projectiles will lose health points.

Enemies, when defeated, drop experience gems that level ups the player. Upon level up, the player will be given three choices for power-ups. These power-ups can increase weapon power, speed, and size. The player may also acquire new weapons, holding up to a maximum of three. 

Technical functionalities include:

Collision checks between (player vs enemies), (player vs experience gems), and(enemies vs projectiles). 
Vector changes for enemy pathing
Sprite assets for player, enemies, and projectiles
Canvas for background/map, viewpoint, and levelup pop-up for power-up
Gamestate pause does not include projectile creation (each projectile has its own setInterval)

Background
A 1-2 paragraph description of your project, providing the necessary context for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it does.

Functionality & MVPs
Fill in this template:

In { project name }, users will be able to:

In addition, this project will include:

{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
{ other aspect of project }
{ other aspect of project }
Wireframes
Draw the layout of your project: the major sections of the game view, the chart and its legend, the game controls and about me links, etc. This doesn't have to be a fully detailed mockup; it can just be labeled boxes showing the layout of your project. See the Sample Proposal for an example.

Wireframe.cc is a great tool for quickly creating wireframes.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you might use a library like three.js. If you're doing data visualization, you might use d3 for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.

Implementation Timeline
Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to work on this project:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday Morning
It can be quite hard to estimate how long parts of your project might take. Don't worry if you end up straying from this timeline; the goal is to have a plan in place for what you'll do & in what order, and to have a tentative pace.

You should also be aware that presentations will be Thursday afternoon, and deploying your project to GitHub Pages will take some time Thursday morning, so don't plan much for that morning.
