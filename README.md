Rogue Survivor takes inspiration from Vampire Survivors, a roguelike survival game.

In Rogue Survivor, you defeat enemies and attempt to survive the timer. Game over if you lose all your health points. 

The player is controlled using WASD/arrow-keys and will navigate around a '2d' plane. Collision with enemies will reduce the player health point. The player weapon is automatic (no keybind) and will "attack" on a set interval, sending projectiles in a unique pattern. Enemies hit by these projectiles will lose health points.

Enemies, when defeated, drop experience gems that level ups the player. Upon level up, the player will be given three choices for power-ups. These power-ups can increase weapon power, speed, and size. The player may also acquire new weapons, holding up to a maximum of three. 

Technical functionalities include:

Collision checks between (player vs enemies), (player vs experience gems), and(enemies vs projectiles). 
Vector changes for enemy pathing
Sprite assets for player, enemies, and projectiles
Canvas for background/map, viewpoint, and levelup pop-up for power-up


To-do:
new abilities as a power-up choice - object
Health and damage parameters
Magnetism for experience gems - player attribute
Game-over logic
boss?
